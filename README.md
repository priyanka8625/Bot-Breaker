# 🛡️ Bot Breaker – AI-Powered Bot Detection for UIDAI

**Bot Breaker** is an AI-powered bot detection system designed to enhance security on the **UIDAI portal**. It passively analyzes user interactions—such as **keystrokes, mouse movements, and time spent on the page**—to determine whether a user is human or a bot. If the detection is inconclusive, an **active CAPTCHA** is triggered for verification.

## 🌟 Features  
✅ **Passive Bot Detection** – Captures behavioral data (mouse movements, keystrokes, time spent)  
✅ **AI/ML Model Analysis** – Uses an ML model to predict bot behavior in real-time  
✅ **Active CAPTCHA (Fallback)** – Users must match two shapes and enter a key combination if flagged as suspicious  
✅ **Seamless API Integration** – Easily integrates with existing UIDAI systems using RESTful APIs  
✅ **Privacy Compliant** – Adheres strictly to UIDAI’s privacy policies
